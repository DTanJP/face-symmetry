* CISC 4900 Project "Face Symmetry"

The goal of this project is to write an R function to calculate the
symmetry of a face.

* Specifications

A prototype for the desired function is:

faceSymmetry( filename, axisSearch=0, xmin=NA, xmax=NA, ymin=NA, ymax=NA )

* Materials

- The Faces/ folder contains a few examples of faces
